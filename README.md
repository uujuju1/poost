> Hello, Drifted Notes (formerly 1237) talking, 
> Most of the tracks in the mod are now deleted.<br>
> Why? i don't have time to write the long (real) answer, but the short answer is: because 1237 is """"dead"""".<br>
> but if you really want to play the mod with the old soundtracks, go to the releases tab and download the first release.<br>
> Expect a remaster in a month or two.
