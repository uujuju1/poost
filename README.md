> Hello,
> Most of the tracks (i mean all of 1237 tracks) in the mod are now deleted.<br>
> Why? ~~i don't want to talk about it~~.<br>
> but if you really want to play the mod with the old soundtracks, go to the releases tab and download the first release.<br>
> I will re~~master~~make all of them and release them soon.
<br><br>Drifted Notes
<!--i commented this because dj silin tracks are not uploaded here and because i deleted all 1237 tracks.-->
